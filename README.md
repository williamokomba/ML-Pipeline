# ML Pipeline

* A machine learning pipeline is a sequence of data processing steps, where each step transforms the data and prepares it for the next step.
* The primary goal of a pipeline is to automate the workflow of data preparation, model training, and evaluation, ensuring that the process is consistent and repeatable.
